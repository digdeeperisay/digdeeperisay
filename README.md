- 👋 Hi, I’m @digdeeperisay aka Prem Rajamohan (or is it the other way around?)
- 👀 I’m interested in everything data and I try to learn something new on a regular basis to keep me motivated
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a Lead Data Engineer at Mastercard (do you wanna stalk me on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/premchanderrajamohan/?)
- 💞️ This is a place for me to store all my projects, ideas, certifications etc. so that I can add an additional line on my resume (that helps right?)
- 📫 Drop me a note if you feel like saying hi! (I am always looking for extended car warranties)

Thanks for visiting!
